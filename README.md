# Fixed Splendid Lighting
This is a repo that contains the unbinarized files of "Splendid Lighting" for people to use. Comes with .hemtt files as well but due to binarized p3d's (these can't be unbinarized), the project won't fully build and you'll have to do it manually.

This version also has fixed inheritance, so compatibility with other mods that utilize the same classes is hugely improved.

Splendid Lighting doesn't contain a license, and so this one won't contain either. According to the Steam workshop page edits and re-uploads are allowed when proper credit is given, so if you do decide to use these files in a public release, then you must include these credits.

Everything is provided as-is with no warranty or support. Please do not contact anyone listed in the credits without a very good reason!
